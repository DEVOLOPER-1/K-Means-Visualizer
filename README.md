## ‚öôÔ∏è **How It Works**

### **Algorithm Breakdown**:
1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Generate points and place them around a single centroid.
   - Configure the maximum number of iterations (`MAX_ITERATIONS`).

2. **Clustering Process**:
   - At each iteration:
     - Centroids split into new positions with reduced deviations.
     - Points are assigned to the nearest centroid using **Euclidean distance**.
     - Clusters are color-coded based on membership.

3. **Animation Sequences**:
   - Points scatter from a central position.
   - Centroids split, move, and recalibrate dynamically.
   - Clusters smoothly transition to updated colors.

### **Mathematical Foundations**:
- **Euclidean Distance**: Calculates point-to-centroid proximity.
- **Vector Normalization**: Ensures smooth and adaptive positioning.
- **Adaptive Deviations**: Refines clustering precision with each iteration.

## üíª **Implementation Details**

### **Dynamic Point Management**:
```javascript
let their_positions_after_movement = [];
let circles_objects = [];
let current_centroids = [initial_centroid_location];
```

### **Clustering Logic**:
```javascript
function performIteration() {
    // Splits centroids and recalculates cluster memberships
    // Updates point positions and colors
}
```

### **Animation Timing**:
- Initial Scatter: `200ms` delays between points.
- Cluster Updates: `2000ms` intervals for animations.
- Iteration Spacing: `4000ms` between centroid splits.
